## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Engineering (MSCE) at Tufts University, with an expected graduation date of May 2025. I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at Hangzhou Dianzi University. I am actively seeking a PhD position to further my academic and research pursuits.

## Research Interests

- **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI):** Focusing on human-centered HRI in assistive technologies and industrial robotics.
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):** Investigating learning mechanisms from critiques, preferences, suggestions, demonstrations, and other forms of human feedback.
- **Robot Learning:** Exploring robotic manipulation, decision-making in dynamic environments.
## News

- **[Sept. 2024]** Our two papers on HRI and RLHF have been submitted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025.
- **[May 2024]** Our paper on RLHF has been accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN) 2024.
