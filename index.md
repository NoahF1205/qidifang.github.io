## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Engineering (MSCE) at Tufts University and will be graduated May 2025. I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at Hangzhou Dianzi University. I am actively seeking a 2025 PhD position to further my academic and research pursuits.

## Research Interests
- **Robot Learning:** Exploring robotic manipulation, decision-making in dynamic environments.
- **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI):** Focusing on human-centered HRI in assistive technologies and industrial robotics.
- **Learning from Human Feedback (LfHF):** Investigating learning mechanisms from critiques, preferences, suggestions, demonstrations, and other forms of human feedback.
## News

- **[March 2025]** Our two papers about HRI and RLHF have been submitted to IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN) 2025.
- **[May 2024]** Our paper about LfHF has been accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN) 2024.
